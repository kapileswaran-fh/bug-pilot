# 🐞 Bug Pilot

Bug Pilot is a lightweight bug-reporting assistant designed to make issue tracking fast and intuitive.  
It allows users to **record on-screen issues with voice narration**, capture the context, and automatically **convert them into tickets**. These tickets are then available in a **centralized dashboard** for easy tracking and resolution.
